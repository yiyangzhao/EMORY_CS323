AVL: 
After deleting a node, we identify if it has child(ren) and apply approprate algorithm to get it removed; after recursively balance its parents if the node (and the sub tree till this point) is not balanced. We using rotations to balance the nodes in all four cases.

Black and Red tree: We first remove it using the same procedure and then balance it; We first identify if it is a double black case; a series of rotations is then performed.
