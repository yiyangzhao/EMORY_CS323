Proof: max-flow equv. min-cut



for any edges connecting two sets, the maxium flow <= the capacity of the total of those edges (Max flow M< Capacity of cut)

Thus the max flow should <= any possible cut.

For a maxflow in the network we can construct a cut that follows:

we seperate all the verticies as 1)used and reached in the maxflow 2)not reached

We construct a cut that seperate all verticies in two sets, S in one and T in another

let C be the capacity of the cut

C = sum (c(forward edge))

for each edge goes from set with S to set with T, f=c

for each going back T set to S set, f=0

So C(minimum cut) = max flow
