Let S be the set of all vertices on the shortest path found by Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
Prove that the distances[u] is the minimum length between the vertex u and the target vertex t.
Base case
	When |S| = 1, it is true.
Induction case
	Assume that it is true for |S| = k > 1.
	V is the next vertex that is added to S
	We have an edge t -> v
	p(v) = the shortest path u->t + t->v
	Any other path from u to v have length >=p(v)
	Let x->y be the first edge S->y, P' is a subpath ->x
	length(P)>=length(P')+length(x->y)>=dis(x)+length(x->y) >= p(y) >= p(v)
	So Dijkstra choose v before y
	So the resulting path is shortest
